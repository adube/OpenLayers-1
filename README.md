I do not own OpenLayers nor am I a developper for them. I added a functionality I needed so that
MapServer UTFGrid can be used.

For informations on copyrights and how to use/install OpenLayers:
[OpenLayers' git](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers)

## OpenLayers versions with WMS support for UTFGrid. 

Use it as you would use OpenLayers. Adding a UTFGridWMS layer is the same as adding a UTFGrid layer.
Just use OpenLayers.Layer.UTFGridWMS in your code. The parameters are the same.

Note: SingleTile: false isn't functionnal yet.
